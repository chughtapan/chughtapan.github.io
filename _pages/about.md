I am a fifth year PhD student at the University of Washington, where I am advised by [Prof. Arvind Krishnamurthy](http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind) and [Prof. Ratul Mahajan](https://ratul.org). I am broadly interested in distributed systems and machine learning systems. My recent projects revolve around optimizing resource efficiency of machine learning applications. 

My academic journey is complemented by valuable industrial experiences. I am currently engaged as a student researcher at [Systems Research @ Google](https://techsysinfra.google/research/) where I work on optimizing accelerator efficiency for ML serving. Previously, I collaborated with [Srikanth Kandula](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/srikanth/) and [Ishai Menache](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ishai/) as a research intern and visitor at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/). Before starting my PhD, I spent two years as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India working with [Dr. Muthian Sivathanu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/muthian/).
