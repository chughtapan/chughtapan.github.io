I am PhD student at the University of Washington, where I am advised by [Prof. Arvind Krishnamurthy](http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind) and [Prof. Ratul Mahajan](https://ratul.org). I am broadly interested in distributed systems and machine learning systems.

Previously, I spent two awesome years as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India working with [Dr. Muthian Sivathanu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/muthian/).
